# afa-client

I chose nextjs because AFA seems to use React for it's FE-stuff, and because
I've never used nextjs and this seemed like a good project to test it out.

## To run

```bash
npm run dev
```

The client will start at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## TODO
* Tests
* Styling
* React component structure
* Improved error visualization
* Edge case sanity checks
